# Per-Session Process Isolation — Design (M6)

> gofer milestone — **shipped**, behind the still-opt-in, off-by-default `gofer daemon --workers` flag. Merged to `main` via #114 and 15+ follow-on slice PRs; Phases 0-3 are complete, Phase 4 (lifecycle polish) is where the remaining work lives (§11). Detached per-session worker processes behind a thin router daemon, so the daemon and CLI can be upgraded in place while live turns finish uninterrupted on the binary that started them. Phase 4's two headline items remain open: offline `resume` spawning a fresh worker ([#139](https://github.com/jedwards1230/gofer/issues/139)) and cost/usage aggregation + graceful drain ([#140](https://github.com/jedwards1230/gofer/issues/140)).

## 1. Goal & the one-line thesis

The daemon and CLI are already separate processes. This milestone makes **each session its own detached OS process** (`gofer session-worker`). A session's whole turn machinery — the SDK runner, the prompt pump, the approval gate, the journal writer, the event broker — runs inside its worker. The daemon shrinks to a **router**: roster aggregation, client fan-out, worker discovery/adoption, and the ACP surface. Because nothing version-coupled to the SDK runs in the router, **the router (and the CLI) can be upgraded or restarted at will; in-flight turns keep running on their worker's old binary and simply finish; the next `session/new` spawns a worker on the new binary.** Mixed binary versions coexist by construction.

The design is not exotic: gofer **already** ships a lossless, process-crossing, per-session event stream (`internal/daemonbridge` reconstructs a session's typed `event.Event` broker from a remote daemon's wire). That machinery is the template; this milestone applies it one tier deeper.

## 2. Where the boundary goes (the key decision)

The supervisor already isolates the SDK behind one seam — the `Session` interface (`internal/supervisor/types.go:59`), the subset of `runner.Runner` the supervisor drives, with injectable `NewSession`/`ResumeSession` factories (`supervisor.go:51-55`). Everything above that interface (the `managed` pump, the prompt queue, the per-session `*loop.Gate`, `watchPermissions`, the roster) is thin, version-stable gofer code; everything the interface reaches (`runner.New`/`Resume`, `Prompt`, `SetModel`, `Emit`, `Cost`, the broker, the journal) is SDK-version-coupled.

The naive boundary — put a worker *below* the `Session` interface, keep the pump in the daemon — **does not achieve the goal.** The pump's `m.sess.Prompt(turnCtx, text)` call (`managed.go:254`) drives a turn; if it lives in the daemon and the daemon restarts, that call is severed and the turn is abandoned mid-flight. Likewise the `*loop.Gate`: if an approval is outstanding when the daemon dies and the gate lives in the daemon, the await is lost.

So the boundary goes **above** `managed`: the **worker owns the pump, the gate, `watchPermissions`, the runner, the broker, and the journal** — i.e. essentially today's `supervisor.managed` + the SDK runner. The elegant realization: **a worker is a single-session daemon.** It runs `supervisor.New` capped at one session and serves the *existing daemon wire* (ACP v1 + `gofer/*` native) over a unix socket. The router's "supervisor" then becomes a **`daemonbridge`-shaped remote proxy** — the exact class that already reconstructs a session's event stream from that wire.

```
        client wire (unchanged ACP + gofer/*)         router↔worker wire (the SAME wire + gofer/hello)
 CLI / phone / editor ──────────────►  gofer daemon (router) ──────────────►  gofer session-worker (one per session)
   ACP client              WebSocket       · roster (union: workers + disk)      unix socket  · supervisor(1 session)
                                           · peer fan-out (sessionPeers)                       · runner.Runner + broker + journal
                                           · discovery / adoption / spawn                      · pump + prompt queue
                                           · permission ROUTING (no gate)                      · *loop.Gate (the gate lives HERE)
                                           · ACP surface                                       · version-coupled: SDK loop runs HERE
```

Net effect: the two hops speak one protocol (the public client wire), and each tier reuses code that already exists — the worker reuses `daemon.Serve` + `supervisor`, the router reuses `daemonbridge` reconstruction + the `sessionPeers` fan-out.

## 3. Process model

**Spawn & detachment.** On `session/new`, the router forks/execs `gofer session-worker --session <uuid> --root <root> [--model <model>]` (`internal/router/router.go:612`, `buildWorkerCmd`). `session-worker`'s entire flag surface is `--session`/`--model`/`--root`/`--log-level` (`cmd/gofer/session_worker.go:38-43`) — there is no `--listen` on it; `--listen` belongs to the `daemon` command (`cmd/gofer/daemon.go:84`). The worker instead derives its own unix-socket path from the pinned session id (`daemon.WorkerSocketPath`, `internal/daemon/runtimedir.go:78-100`) — the basename is a 16-hex-char SHA-256 prefix of the uuid, not `<uuid>.sock`, because a full 36-char UUIDv7 basename under a long macOS `$TMPDIR` fallback overflows the ~104-byte `sun_path` limit on unix-domain sockets — binds it, and advertises the address by writing the `<uuid>.json` endpoint file (§4). The router discovers that file via a short poll loop (`internal/router/router.go`'s `waitForWorkerEndpoint`), not by reading the socket path back from argv. The worker is detached so it outlives the router: `SysProcAttr{Setsid: true}` (new session + process group, no controlling terminal), stdio redirected to a per-worker log file. Unix-only, matching the repo's posture (no Windows build — see `pidAlive`'s comment).

- **Linux**: `setsid` reparents the worker to `init`/the nearest subreaper when the router exits.
- **macOS**: the router is already a launchd *user agent* (`service_darwin.go`). Workers are **not** launchd jobs — plain detached processes that reparent to `launchd` (pid 1) on router exit; launchd reaps their eventual exit but never tracks or kills them. When launchd restarts the router (KeepAlive), the new router re-adopts the orphaned workers by socket scan (§4). Workers are login-session-scoped, same as the daemon today.

**Orphan reaping.** While the router lives it is the worker's parent, so it runs a per-worker `cmd.Wait()` reaper goroutine to avoid zombies. On router shutdown it **does not signal workers** — it just stops waiting; orphaned workers reparent to pid 1, which reaps them. (No double-fork needed; the router learns each worker's pid from its endpoint file.)

**Crash isolation.**
- *Worker dies ≠ fleet dies.* A panic/OOM kills one session's process only. The router observes the socket close, marks that session **offline** (a resumable journal), fans a terminal `session.error` to attached peers, leaves every other worker untouched.
- *Router dies ≠ workers die.* Detached workers keep pumping turns, keep their gates, keep journaling. A new router adopts them; in-flight turns finish uninterrupted. **This is the milestone's whole point.**
- *Journals are the durable truth.* A session whose worker is gone with no live turn is just a JSONL journal — resume spawns a fresh worker.

## 4. Reattach / adoption protocol

**Per-worker endpoint convention.** Mirror the daemon's own endpoint-file precedent (`cmd/gofer/daemon.go`, `internal/daemon/endpoint.go`). Each worker writes, atomically at startup, `<runtime>/gofer-<uid>/workers/<uuid>.json` (mode 0600) advertising `{addr: unix://…/<uuid>.sock, pid, binaryVersion, wireVersion, startedAt}` and removes it on clean exit. (`acpProtocolVersion` is **not** listed here: it is advertised/confirmed via the `gofer/hello` handshake in §6, not negotiated at ACP `initialize` — which today does not run at all.) `<runtime>` follows the same scheme the daemon socket already uses (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gofer-<uid>…`, with the daemon's existing macOS fallback).

**Discovery on router start.** Scan `workers/`; for each endpoint file:
1. `pidAlive(pid)` (reuse `cmd/gofer/daemon.go:pidAlive` — signal-0 probe) **and**
2. dial + `gofer/hello` handshake (reuse `daemon.Probe` shape).

Both pass → **adopt**: open a `daemon.Client` to the worker, wrap it in the router's `daemonbridge`-shaped remote supervisor, pull the worker's `SessionInfo` into the roster, re-subscribe to its event stream (must-deliver replay §6 re-surfaces any open permission request). Either fails → **stale**: unlink the endpoint file (best-effort), treat the session as offline/resumable.

**Failure matrix.**

| Situation | Detection | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Stale socket (file present, no listener) | dial refused | unlink file; session offline |
| Dead worker, live socket file (pid gone) | `pidAlive` false | unlink file; session offline |
| Live pid, unresponsive worker | handshake timeout | leave file; mark degraded, do **not** route prompts; kill path reaps |
| Two routers racing | router endpoint guard (`guardLiveEndpoint`, already exists) | second router fails fast ("already running") — one router owns the roster |
| Duplicate worker for one session id | per-session lockfile (below) | second worker fails to acquire → exits |

**Single-writer guard.** The SDK journal is **not** protected by a cross-process advisory flock — the only flock in the SDK is `auth.lock` on the token store; journal writes are guarded by an *in-process* semaphore only. So gofer must enforce one-worker-per-session itself: (a) the router refuses to spawn a second worker for a session id it already has a live worker for, and (b) the worker acquires a gofer-side advisory lock on `<uuid>.lock` (`LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB`) before opening the runner and hard-fails if held — the authoritative guard against a racing adopt+spawn.

## 5. Event streaming across the boundary

Already exists at the client↔daemon tier; applied verbatim at router↔worker.

- The worker owns a real `event.Broker` (two-tier delivery: lossy deltas dropped under backpressure, `TierMustDeliver` lifecycle/terminal events blocked-with-bound; `WithReplay(n)` retains the last *n* must-deliver events for late subscribers). Its journal is the append-only JSONL truth. **Backlog and replay live in the worker**, next to the runner that produces them — never proxied.
- The worker emits every event on the wire as `gofer/event`: **the source event's own `MarshalJSON` envelope, verbatim** (`internal/daemon/handlers.go:broadcastGoferEvent`). This is lossless — `tool.call.delta` input fragments and `tool.call.finished` `Diagnostics`/`Spill*` fields, both absent from ACP's `session/update`, survive.
- The router reconstructs each session's typed stream by decode-dispatch-publish into a per-session broker via the SDK's `event.New*` constructors — **exactly `handleGoferEvent`**, which M6 extracted from `daemonbridge` into `internal/wirestream/reconstruct.go`. Attach/peek fidelity, the history-before-live ordering guarantee, and the `TurnFinished`-vs-last-event ordering all carry over because the reconstruction is already written and tested — each property by a different test, so cite them separately: **content** fidelity (delta fragments and `Diagnostics`/`Spill*` surviving the wire) by `daemonbridge/fidelity_test.go`'s `TestFidelityToolCallDeltaAndSpill`, and **history-before-live ordering** by `daemonbridge/bridge_test.go`'s `TestAttachReplaysHistory` and `wirestream/subscribe_firstref_test.go`'s `TestSubscribeLiveFirstReferenceReplaysHistory`. `fidelity_test.go` proves nothing about ordering.
- The router re-fans reconstructed events to attached clients through the **existing** `sessionPeers` registry (`broadcastGoferEvent`/`broadcastUpdate`). Clients see no change: the same `session/update` + `gofer/event` they see today.

The one genuinely new cost is the **second hop** (worker→router→client vs daemon→client): local unix-socket RTT + a JSON re-encode per event — µs-scale, already paid once at the client hop, now paid twice. Below human-perceptible latency for interactive use; noted honestly as the per-event tax.

## 6. The versioned router↔worker wire contract

**It is the daemon's existing public wire** — ACP v1 JSON-RPC plus the `gofer/*` native methods. This is deliberate: **not a net-new compatibility surface**, but the surface gofer already maintains for clients, now also spoken internally. The event envelope *is* the journal serialization (both are `event.Event.MarshalJSON`), so wire and journal share one compat surface, not two.

**Negotiation.** There is no in-protocol version handshake to inherit: `daemon.Client.Dial` performs no ACP `initialize`, and ACP's `InitializeResponse` carries no version field. So version exchange must be **designed into the router↔worker contract from day one — it cannot be assumed from ACP.** Two mechanisms, both gofer-native, layered:

1. **Endpoint-file advertisement (discovery-time).** The worker's `<uuid>.json` advertises `{binaryVersion, wireVersion}` — mirroring the daemon/CLI version-warning approach of carrying the daemon's version via `daemon.json`. The router reads this during the adoption *scan* (§4), before it even dials, to make an adopt/spawn/skew-route decision from the file alone.
2. **In-protocol handshake (authoritative).** A gofer-native `gofer/hello` the router calls first on every worker connection, returning `{binaryVersion, wireVersion, acpProtocolVersion}`. Required, not optional: router and worker **must** know each other's versions to route around skew (the whole point), and the endpoint file alone is insufficient — it can be stale and doesn't cover a re-dial after the file is gone. The handshake is the source of truth; the endpoint file is the cheap pre-dial hint.

**Why both, and the forward payoff:** the file keeps adoption cheap and reuses the existing mechanism; `gofer/hello` makes version knowledge authoritative and connection-scoped. Crucially, this gofer-native handshake is the **template that later subsumes the endpoint-file limitation for remote/explicitly-addressed daemons** — a client or fleet router that can only reach a daemon by address, with no local endpoint file, can ask it its version in-band via the same `gofer/hello`.

**Compatibility window — the honest simplification.** The router does not need to fully support N versions of the worker wire. Two facts shrink the obligation:
1. Workers are **short-lived** — one session each. The max skew a router must tolerate is bounded by the *longest running session*, not by release cadence.
2. A skewed in-flight session only needs to **finish**, not accept new work. So the router must forward-support only the **observe + permission-reply + terminal-event subset** across a version gap — which the additive event wire already is — and may **refuse to route a *new prompt* to a version-skewed worker**, letting the current turn finish and the next prompt wait for a fresh worker on the router's own binary.

Shipped policy: exact-match-or-bust on the wire axis, unlimited on the binary axis — two independent checks, not a numbered window. `classifySkew` (`internal/router/skew.go:81-92`) checks `wireVersion` first: any mismatch, of any size, puts the worker in `skewWire`, and `skewClass.refusesNewWork()` (`skew.go:60-62`) refuses new work for `skewWire` alone. A `binaryVersion` mismatch with a *matching* wire version (`skewBinary`) is fully routable with no cap on how far the binaries have drifted — that unlimited tolerance is the session-pinning behavior a rolling upgrade needs. Full routing requires the current wire, period; binary skew was never restricted. Governance rides the **existing** promote-if-stable policy + additive-field discipline — `daemonbridge` already tolerates unknown methods (silently dropped) and additive fields.

## 7. Permissions across processes

The gate stays with the turn — **in the worker.** The round trip:

1. Worker's `RuleGuard` hits an ask → holds the worker's `*loop.Gate`, blocks the turn, emits `event.PermissionRequested` on its stream.
2. Router observes it (it's subscribed), records the call-id→session route (`recordPermRoute`), fans it out to peers **exactly as today**: `gofer/permission_requested` to gofer clients **and** the spec-ACP `session/request_permission` request to ACP peers. First answer from any surface wins.
3. A peer replies → router `handlePermissionReply` looks up the route and calls its supervisor's `Reply(sessionID, …)`. In the router that supervisor is the remote proxy, so `Reply` forwards `permission.reply` over the **owning worker's** IPC (precisely what `daemonbridge.Supervisor.Reply` already does). The worker's local supervisor resolves its gate; the turn proceeds.

**Survives a router restart mid-approval:** the worker keeps holding its gate and blocking the turn; the new router adopts the worker, re-subscribes, and the still-open `PermissionRequested` re-surfaces via must-deliver **replay**; it re-fans to peers; the reply routes through. Nothing is lost because the gate never left the worker and the backlog never left the worker's broker.

> **Adoption-time pure-ACP exception (open):** the standing per-adopted-session watcher re-fans a re-surfaced permission only as the gofer-native `gofer/permission_requested` notification (and records its call-id→session route, so *any* client's routed `permission.reply` resolves it). It does **not** re-issue the spec-ACP `session/request_permission` request, so a pure-ACP peer (a phone) cannot *answer* a re-surfaced permission on an adopted session. Phase 3 (version skew + the hot-upgrade story, §11) shipped without closing this gap — `internal/daemon/permission_relay.go`'s doc comment, last touched after Phase 3 landed, still defers the ACP-ask wiring to an unscheduled future phase. gofer clients (TUI/daemonbridge) are unaffected.

## 8. Lifecycle deltas

| Op | Today (in-process) | With workers |
|---|---|---|
| `session/new` | `supervisor.Create` → `runner.New` goroutine | router spawns+detaches a worker, adopts it, proxies the first prompt |
| `session/prompt` | pump `Prompt` in-process | router forwards `session/prompt` to the worker; the worker's pump drives it |
| `kill` | cancel `baseCtx`, reap goroutine, emit `session.killed` | router sends `gofer/kill` → worker stops its pump, emits `session.killed`, exits; router reaps pid, unlinks endpoint |
| `archive` | drop from roster, keep journal | worker not required live; router archives from roster/disk; a live worker is killed first |
| `resume` | `runner.Resume` from journal | Design: router spawns a **fresh** worker with `--resume <uuid>`; also the normal "pick up an offline/old-binary session on the new binary" path. **Not yet true** — offline resume remains Phase 4 scope, tracked as [#139](https://github.com/jedwards1230/gofer/issues/139): `Supervisor.Resume` today only reattaches a session the router already hosts **live**, returning `ErrResumeUnsupported` for any id with no live handle (`internal/router/methods.go:171-181`); `session-worker` also has no `--resume` flag yet (`cmd/gofer/session_worker.go:33`) |
| `session/list` | roster (live) ∪ disk enumeration | router serves **union**: adopted live workers (each reports its own `SessionInfo`) ∪ disk journals for offline/archived. Router links the SDK **session** package for journal-metadata reads + event decode only — never the runner/loop |
| usage/cost | `runner.Cost()` from journal | worker reports `Cost` in its `SessionInfo` snapshots; router reads cost from the journal directly for offline sessions |
| `-local` / daemonless | in-process supervisor | **unchanged — stays in-process.** A one-shot `gofer exec` or daemonless TUI run *is* its own process; forcing a worker there adds a fork for no upgrade benefit. Process isolation is a daemon-hosted-path feature only |

## 9. What lives where, and the SDK question

- **Worker links the SDK runner/loop** (version-coupled execution). **Router does not** — it links the SDK only for event decode + read-only journal-metadata parsing, both forward-compatible (unknown kinds dropped, additive JSONL fields ignored). This keeps the router upgradeable independent of workers and the compat surface honest.
- **The version handshake needs no SDK change.** `gofer/hello` is gofer-native, owned the same way `gofer/event` is.
- **One new SDK seam WAS required and taken: `runner.Options.SessionID`** (shipped in SDK v0.11.0, consumed at `cmd/gofer/session_worker.go`). *This corrects an earlier claim in this section that "no new SDK seam is required."* Option A (§4) has the router pre-generate a session's uuid to key the worker's socket, endpoint file and lock **before** the worker starts, so the worker must make its session adopt that exact id. gofer first bridged this with a stateful `IDGen` whose first draw returned the pinned uuid; the SDK then added `SessionID` specifically to replace that bridge, and the bridge was deleted. The seam is strictly better than what it replaced: it pins at session creation rather than "whenever the store happens to draw first," and it validates the id before it becomes a journal filename.
- **`event.Unmarshal` has landed in the SDK** (v0.11.0, `event/unmarshal.go`) — the canonical inverse of `MarshalJSON` this section anticipated. gofer has **not yet adopted it**; the hand-rolled per-kind switch still lives in `internal/wirestream/reconstruct.go`, *not* in `daemonbridge` as this section originally said — the reconstruction core was extracted to its own package during M6. Swapping the hand-rolled decoder for `event.Unmarshal` is tracked separately and is not a milestone blocker; the original judgement that gofer should ship without waiting on it held.

## 10. Costs & risks (stated honestly)

- **Memory: N processes, not N goroutines.** Each worker is a full Go runtime (~10–20 MB RSS baseline) + the loop's working set, vs a goroutine's KB. 20 sessions ≈ 20 processes. Acceptable for the target ("an operator running N agents" — tens, not thousands); the isolation is the product. Mitigated by `router.Config.MaxWorkers` (`gofer daemon --workers --max-workers N`, uncapped by default), which refuses `session/new` with `ErrAtCapacity` before forking once N workers are live.
- **Startup latency per session.** fork/exec + runtime init + `runner.New` + journal open (tens of ms) vs a goroutine (µs). Fine for human-initiated `session/new`; would matter only for rapid programmatic fan-out.
- **Per-event IPC tax.** The second hop doubles the per-event encode/socket cost already paid at the client hop. µs-scale, sub-perceptual for interactive use.
- **Compat-surface maintenance.** A supported internal wire with a version window. Mitigated because it is the *same* surface as the public client wire (already maintained), and the in-flight-only compat simplification (§6) shrinks the forward-support obligation to the additive event subset.
- **Portability.** `setsid` detachment is Unix-only — but the repo ships no Windows build, so no new loss.
- **What does NOT change:** the client-facing ACP surface; the journal format; the SDK contract; `-local` mode. Blast radius is `internal/daemon` (supervisor dependency → interface), a new `gofer session-worker` command reusing `daemon.Serve`+`supervisor`, and a router-side remote supervisor reusing `daemonbridge`.

**Deliberate cuts:** process isolation does **not** apply to `-local`/daemonless mode (§8), and full N-version bidirectional wire compat is deferred in favor of the in-flight-only subset (§6).

## 11. Phased rollout

Each phase lands shippable value on its own.

Phases 0-3 have shipped. Phase 4 has not — its two headline items are open, tracked below.

- **Phase 0 — prerequisite (shipped):** build-version identification (`vX.Y.Z` / VCS-derived pseudo-versions) + the daemon/CLI version-mismatch warning. Feeds the endpoint file's `binaryVersion` and `gofer/hello`.
- **Phase 1 — worker behind a flag; router must outlive it (shipped).** Extract the daemon's concrete `*supervisor.Supervisor` dependency to an **interface** (the methods `handlers.go` calls). Add `gofer session-worker` = a single-session `daemon.Serve` over a unix socket. Add a router-side remote supervisor (daemonbridge-shaped) that spawns one worker per `session/new` and proxies. As landed, this phase alone was **not detached yet** — worker was an ordinary child; if the router died, the worker died (documented) — until Phase 2 added detachment. Ships: **crash isolation**. *Demo:* `kill -9` a worker; the daemon and every other session survive; the killed session shows offline and resumes.
- **Phase 2 — detach + adoption (shipped).** `Setsid`; per-worker endpoint files + `<uuid>.lock`; router scans and adopts on startup; router stops signalling workers on shutdown; reaper handles zombies; the §4 failure matrix. *Demo:* restart the daemon while a session sits idle-attached; it survives and re-adopts; peers reconnect to live state.
- **Phase 3 — version skew + the hot-upgrade story (shipped — this is the milestone criterion).** `gofer/hello` handshake + endpoint version fields; router negotiates; the in-flight-only compat subset + skew tests; a skewed worker is observed + reply-able + allowed to finish, but new prompts route to a fresh worker. *Demo (the milestone criterion):* upgrade the daemon binary mid-turn; the running session finishes uninterrupted on the old worker; the next `session/new` runs the new binary; `session/list` shows mixed `binaryVersion`s. Proven by the M6 upgrade-demo test.
- **Phase 4 — lifecycle completeness (polish) (open).** `resume` spawns a fresh worker — **not yet, open as** [#139](https://github.com/jedwards1230/gofer/issues/139); cost/usage aggregation across workers and graceful worker drain on `gofer daemon uninstall` — **not yet, open as** [#140](https://github.com/jedwards1230/gofer/issues/140); roster reconciliation edge cases — status unverified.

**Riskiest phase: Phase 1** — relocating the pump + gate into the worker and rewiring the daemon's supervisor to a remote proxy (the interface extraction).

**Cheapest de-risking prototype (do this first):** wire the **existing** `daemonbridge` as a router→worker proxy with **zero new wire code** — run one `gofer daemon` as the "worker" on a socket, and a second `gofer daemon` as the "router" whose supervisor is a `daemonbridge` pointed at the first. This proves reconstruction fidelity and the *double-hop* event + permission round-trip end-to-end before committing to the single-session-worker refactor.

## 12. Milestone framing

Slots as the **next** gofer milestone after M5 (ACP featureset), pushing ecosystem and auto+polish back one. **No SDK *milestone* was required** — the SDK's Event/Op contract, two-tier broker, and journal already supported out-of-process reconstruction. That held: M6 needed no SDK milestone, only two additive seams shipped in v0.11.0 (`runner.Options.SessionID`, adopted; `event.Unmarshal`, available but not yet adopted). See §9, which records the correction — the original "no new SDK seam is required" claim did not survive contact with Option A's id-pinning requirement.

**Honors the invariants:** contract-only SDK consumption (the boundary is the existing typed wire); everything-is-a-client (the router↔worker hop *is* an ACP+gofer client relationship — the worker gets no privileged path, and neither does the router); journals never deleted (they become the adoption/resume source of truth); SDK-promotion membership test applied to both v0.11.0 seams (see §9 — `runner.Options.SessionID` was required and is adopted; `event.Unmarshal` shipped but is not yet consumed).

---

**Implementation pointers (code-verified):** boundary seam is `internal/supervisor/types.go:59` (`Session` interface) + `supervisor.go:51-55` (injectable factories); the reusable cross-process template is `handleGoferEvent`, extracted during M6 from `daemonbridge` into `internal/wirestream/reconstruct.go` (this pointer originally named `internal/daemonbridge/reconstruct.go`, which no longer exists); the fan-out to preserve is `internal/daemon/handlers.go:broadcastGoferEvent`/`broadcastPermission`; the adoption primitives to mirror are `cmd/gofer/daemon.go:pidAlive`/`guardLiveEndpoint` + `internal/daemon/endpoint.go`.

Two facts verified against the code: (1) the SDK journal has **no** cross-process flock (only `auth.lock` exists) → single-writer-per-session is a gofer-side `<uuid>.lock`, not an SDK freebie; (2) there is **no** version in any handshake today → version negotiation is built into the gofer-native wire from day one (endpoint file + `gofer/hello`), not inherited from ACP.
